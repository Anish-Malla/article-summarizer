### <em>Summarize Articles, Save Time</em>

Article Summarizer is an application which allows user to summarise an article.

The user can input an article as plain text or they can input the URL of the article. Given an article this application extracts
the key sentences from the article and returns one or more summaries.

## Website

## How it works

1. Getting the article's text (comes from URL or text inputted by user)
2. This text is ran through an extractive graph based summariser
3. The summariser ranks the sentences based upon importance and the result is outputted to the user
